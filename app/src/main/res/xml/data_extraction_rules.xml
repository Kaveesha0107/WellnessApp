             By default, all shared preferences, files in getFilesDir() and getDatabasePath()
             are backed up.
             Use <include /> and <exclude /> tags. For example:
        <exclude domain="sharedpref" path="temporary_session_data.xml"/>
        <exclude domain="database" path="my_temp_db"/>

        <include domain="sharedpref" path="WellnessAppPrefs.xml"/> <!-- Include your main preferences -->
        <exclude domain="sharedpref" path_pattern=".*_temp\.xml"/> <!-- Example: exclude temp prefs -->
